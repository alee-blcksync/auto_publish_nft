# auto_publish_nft
Metaplex Candy Machine V2 automation script for testing

To setup environment, etc.
You only need to run this once.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

To create your NFT and upload to Solana devnet.
You can run this many times, each time creates a new set of NFT with a new Candy Machine.
We re-use the same jpeg/png files and metadata here as an example only.
